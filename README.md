# Simple Reflection System - C++ (Example)

## About
An extremely bare-bones implementation of a reflection system with templating. This is meant to demo how you might implement a system that can allow for reflection-like behavior in a C++ application using a custom reflection system.

## Additional Information
* There is currently a new standard for C++ reflection in the standard library. However, this demonstrates a simple reflection system you can build for your own purposes.
* This is primarily for educational purposes.

## Usage
1. Create a C++ project.
2. Drop this in as your main file.
3. Compile and run!
4. Should be all you need!
